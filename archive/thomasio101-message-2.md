@tatumizer : I think [Funtion.apply](https://api.dartlang.org/stable/2.1.1/dart-core/Function/apply.html) lacks some of the functionality that would be provided by destructuring, such as [Property destructuring](https://github.com/DirectMyFile/dep-destructuring/blob/master/proposal.md#property-destructuring).

I shall do some performance testing right now, I will post a new comment here with a detailed description of the methods and my results.
