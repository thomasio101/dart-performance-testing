@tatumizer I'll immediately get to work on a simpler test, following your advice!  By the way, I was already thinking of increasing the number of iterations, as there is barely any cost to increasing the test to tens of thousands of iterations.

*Anyways, thanks for your response.*

Edit: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention this, but one issue that I see with my previous approach is that there is quite a potential for floating-point errors.
